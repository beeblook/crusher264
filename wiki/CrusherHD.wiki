#summary CrusherHD reference design platform

= Device Options: =
*still not full, or some options may not work*
 * H264 High/Main/Baseline profiles up to level 4.1.
 * Supports mpeg streams as input.
 * can encode up to 4 D1 streams at the same time.
 * can encode HD streams up to 1080i 50Hz
 * _lack of deinterlacing?_


In this mode USB-Device receiving compressed mpeg video over USB from host-pc, encode it, and send this data over USB to host-pc. Compressed video, that sent to device - is in mpeg2-pes format with only I-frames (like DV). Every even-odd bytes are swapped. Also every frame aligned with padding stream (0xbe).
